(emphasis on a copy of the data because in the case that these nodes went down, we would still want to preserve the robust nature of a decentralized system). these new types of nodes would have no extra “power” or authority in the distrubuted file system.this would ensure the fast access that web2 systems provide with the censorship resistant and non-discriminatory nature of web3 systems. of course these new types of nodes would be entitled to some sort of “reward” for hosting this data but I have not had the chance to fully flesh out the economy of a system like this.as much as I believe in an internet built on top of web3 technologies, I don’t think its a bad idea to sometimes revisit our roots and see what allowed web2 technology to thrive for the past 3 decades. sometimes these ideas may just lead to the next big innovation in web3 and this is what I believe I have found here. a still fully decentralized system that draws upon some of the best aspects of web2.its hard for me to say if an internet on built on web2 or web3 will completely dominate but I would not be suprised if a web2.5 happens.I can say with confidence though, a web5 system will never take over the internet :)",
